# MyBank

MyBank is a C++ banking application designed with a user-friendly graphical interface 
(GUI) that simulates essential banking operations. Built as a project for CPE104L 
(Data Structures and Algorithms), MyBank utilizes core concepts like linked lists, queues, 
stacks, and binary search trees to manage customer accounts, transactions, and financial data 
efficiently. The application supports features like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, 
balance inquiries, and transaction histories, making it a comprehensive demonstration of 
data structure implementation in a practical, real-world context.
